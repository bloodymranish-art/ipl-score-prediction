# Score Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on building a **score prediction model** using Python and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze input features, perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), train a predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and step-by-step understanding.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(If requirements.txt is not present, install libraries manually)*

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Run `score prediction by anish.ipynb` cell by cell.

## 📊 Results

The notebook demonstrates how the model learns from the data and predicts scores based on input features. Evaluation metrics are used to assess the model’s performance.
